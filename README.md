# The Nightowl
This nightowl brings ease to your eyes in the night, without ruining Discord's defaults that make you learn something for no reason.

# Features
* Sane defaults
* Made for Vizality (Dashboard etc should feel natural)
* Does not change default placements in the sake of being "nicer" (I am looking at you, half of the themes for Discord)
* Eases your eyes, while looking nice too.

# Disadvantages
* WIP right now
* Pretty messed up (right now)
* Made by a guy that only knows basic (s)css and only uses Vizality :p

# Installation

## Cloning
